            Hi, we're HackNC.  Every year, we run a hackathon out of the UNC Computer Science Department, and every time we have a bit of a dilemma - there's always hardware floating around at hackathons, but out here at UNC, we're a bunch of software people.  (Disagree?  Come over and show us we're wrong!)  So we're going to get some hardware together, take an afternoon and play.  Maybe you're in BME, coming out of Junior Design.  Maybe you're a professional out in the community looking for a hobby.  Maybe you don't know a thing, and want to know a thing. You're welcome here. Just register, so we know what to expect :D

            What's a Raspberry Jam?
        </div>
        <div class="data">
            Now, one platform for hardware hacks is the Raspberry Pi - a low power, single board computer capable of running Linux and controlling hardware.  Raspberry Pi people hold events called Raspberry Jams, to show off their stuff.  When we were thinking about creating a hardware event at UNC, we looked to them for inspiration.  Our event is about all sorts of hardware, but since that's where we came from, we thought we'd keep the name!  Want to play with an Arduino?  An IC?  Even a ...BeagleBoard?  You too.  You're welcome here.

But we want to keep things local this time around - if you want to talk buses or gas reimbursements, come back next semester!  We'll be pulling out all the stops for HackNC++, coming Fall 2015.

                We'd love to supplement our event with workshops.  We think they're a great platform for learning a lot quickly.  If you'd like to get involved, and think you could support us by leading a workshop, we'd love to hear from you! contact@hacknc.us  If you want to take a workshop, well, whatever we do, we'll do something on soldering and on arduino basics.  It'd be silly if we didn't.

                We'll be offering a couple prizes for best hack, as always!  We're doing it differently this time.  Because it's hardware, and our event is short, our prizes are intended for teams who've built something before the event, and want to show it off!  Our only stipulation - HackNC should be your first public showing.  We want to inspire you to create something new - not rehash.  Now, you know and we know we can only be so thorough in following your tracks, so keep the spirit of the event in mind!

                We can tell you off the bat we'll have Arduinos and Raspberry Pis, and a hearty selection of sensors to use with them.  However, as far as acquisitions go, we're open to suggestions.  If you're eyeing something in particular shoot us off an email.
